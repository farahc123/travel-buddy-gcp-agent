## Goal of this project

- To create and deploy an AI agent using Vertex AI and Cloud Run that helps users plan travel
- [Project original source here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/devsite/codelabs/building-ai-agents-vertexai?hl=en#1)

## Requirements

- a GCP account
- an `app.py` file containing the code for a basic Flask app
- an `index.html` file containing the code for the app's landing page
- a `Dockerfile` with instructions on how to build the image
- a GCP Artifact Repository (standard, type Docker) with the correct permissions to push the image to
- a file to be added as a data store, which provides additional knowledge base for the agent to consult (on top of the model's default knowledge base) â€” specifically, this data store instructs the agent on how to handle travel-related queries for Wakanda, a fictional location that the base model doesn't contain travel information for

## Steps

1. Create a conversational agent based on a Gemini model (e.g. *gemini-1.5-flash*)
2. Enable the required API
3. Create the playbook for the agent, with the goal of helping customers answer travel-related queries
4. Add instructions to the playbook:
   1. Greet users and ask how you can help them
   2. Use ${TOOL: Alternative Location} if the user's request contains a location that does not exist
5. Add a datastore to the model to handle queries about Wakanda from the file *gs://ai-workshops/agents/data/wakanda.txt*
6. Set the agent's grounding level to *Very low* to apply restrictions that will help prevent hallucinations
7. Save and wait 10-15 minutes for the data store to be processed
8. Test the agent by asking it questions about Wakanda:
  - "What's the best way to get to Wakanda?" ![alt text](images/image-2.png)
  - "Did any real locations inspire Wakanda?" ![alt text](images/image-3.png)
9.  Publish the agent
10. Use the CSS code snippet from the step above to generate code for a simple Flask web app and save this code in a file called *app.py*
11. Create a *requirements.txt* file with the web app's dependencies
12. Create a Dockerfile
13. Use a `gcloud` command to build and push a Docker image for this containerised app to **existing GCR repository**, e.g. `gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/vertex-ai-projects-466609/travel-buddy` ![Docker image deployed](images/image-5.png)
14.  Deploy the app to Cloud Run with a `gcloud run deploy` command, e.g. `gcloud run deploy travel-buddy --image gcr.io/vertex-ai-projects-466609/travel-buddy --platform managed --region northamerica-northeast1 --allow-unauthenticated` ![Cloud Run service deployed](images/image-4.png)
